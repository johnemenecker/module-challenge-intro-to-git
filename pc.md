## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git consists of the commands needed to work with the local and remote repository
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git are the commands. Githug is the remote repository.
3. Why do we create a branch? To work on changes for a fix or feature that ill be merged into the main file
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To submit changes for someone to review the branch
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout or git switch
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch checks to see if any changes have been made, git pull does that and brings a copy of the file from the remote repository, git merge puts branches back together.
7. What is a merge conflict? branches have been edited in the same file, or branch has been deleted in one file and edited in another
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? open it and make necessary changes, use git add, and then git commit
